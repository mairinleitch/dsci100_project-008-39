    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "Coronary artery disease (CAD) poses a significant health challenge, marked by the narrowing of coronary arteries, necessitating precise diagnostic tools for timely intervention and treatment (Detrano, et al.,1989). Traditionally, invasive procedures like angiography have been employed for diagnosis, but they come with inherent risks such as arterial injury, stroke, and radiation exposure (Mayo Clinic, 2021). Recognizing the imperative for safer alternatives, there is an increasing interest in non-invasive diagnostic methods that leverage patient demographics and basic clinical information for CAD diagnosis. This data analysis aims to address this need by evaluating the diagnosis of the presence of heart disease using essential parameters: age, cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure based on the database from the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:** Will the new patient have heart disease or not based on their age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this report comes from the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest. The data consists solely of numerical values. A total of 76 columns of data exist, but only 14 columns are used in the given data tables (Detrano et al., 1989). The 14 available columns are titled ‘age’, ‘sex’, ‘cp’, ‘trestbps’,  ‘chol’, ‘fbs’, ‘restecg’ , ‘thalach’, ‘exang’, ‘oldpeak’, ‘slope’, ‘ca’, ‘thal’, and ‘num’ (Detrano et al., 1989). \n",

    "### **Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized the \"processed.hungary.data\" from the Heart Disease Database. Our predictive variables include age (years), chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dL), and trestbps (resting blood pressure in mmHg) to predict if heart disease is present (1) or absent (0) in Hungarian patients. We imported the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook from the website and conducted data preprocessing to filter the relevant variables, handle missing data, and adjust data types. A 75% training and 25% testing data split was performed. Preliminary exploratory analysis included summary statistics and visualization using scatter plots: Age vs. Serum Cholesterol, Age vs. Resting Blood Pressure, and Serum Cholesterol vs. Resting Blood Pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to find the ideal \"k\" value for k-nearest neighbors, maximizing prediction accuracy through the recipe function, cross-validation, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and a workflow on our training data. Then, we will predict our category (1 or 0) using our model and the testing data, and analyze our findings in a report. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to create a scatterplot to assess potential overfitting or underfitting. We will color code the graph's background based on the model's predictions. We will repeat this for all of our variables (age vs. blood pressure, age vs. cholesterol, cholesterol vs. blood pressure). By comparing the graphs, we can determine which variables are more accurate in predicting the presence of heart disease, and the strengths and limitations of our model. \n"

    "### **Expected outcomes and significance**\n",
    "From this data analysis of heart disease in Hungary, conclusions can be drawn as to how likely a person will be diagnosed with heart disease based on their resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and age. We expect to find a positive relationship between our predictor values (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age) and the presence of heart disease, and a relatively accurate prediction using this classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings can help doctors in Hungary accurately diagnose heart disease patients without using invasive procedures. Also doctors can start to place a higher emphasis on more related parameters during symptom check-ups using the conclusion from this study. Focusing on region-specific data (Hungary) can help doctors benefit the health of the populations they treat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis can prompt the exploration of new questions. For example, how can we use this data to diagnose specific heart conditions (i.e. atherosclerosis, angina, coronary heart disease, etc.) rather than just the general presence of a disease? Are other factors more accurate in a heart disease diagnosis than the ones we are identifying? More specific research questions can be pursued as a result of this analysis. \n"
